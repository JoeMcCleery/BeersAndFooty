The Murderer having killed AFL in Tasmania is now one step closer to murdering the game completely. The global pandemic has given the murder a delicious opportunity to completely destroy the AFL's finances. Sources who are very pissed have suggested that the Murderer is prioritizing beautiful money over local football and fans. Sources have not denied that he hates beers."
