Lachy \"lightweight\" Hunter evidently misunderstood the meaning of \"Zoom Beers?\" when he decided to get absolutely pissed and get behind the wheel of a car and take out 4 cars including his own. He was so cooked that he continued at kickons with Mullet Man and Lady Gowers. Police found Alcohol in the passenger seat of Hunters car and they refused to rule out the possibility it was cider. We can only speculate."
