The reopening of pubs in the NT has brought tears of pride and happiness to the eyes of many Australians and a true blue symbol of hope. AFL players are allegedly now keen to establish so called Pub-Hubs in the Northern Territory to get the season back up and running. The proposal brought forward by Barry from the pub would see AFL teams set up Hubs in an NT Pub where it is understood teams would play a game at the local park and then retire back to the pub for a couple of hard earned frothies."
