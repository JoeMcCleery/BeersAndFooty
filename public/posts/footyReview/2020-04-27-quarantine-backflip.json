      "value": "AFL players are becoming more desperate for the season to restart as willingness to participate in the quarantine hubs increases. Patrick Dangerfield the president of the AFLPA was initially against the idea of setting up quarantine hubs around the country. But now he's more open to the idea as players livelihoods depend on it “To be totally honest, if it’s 16 games in 10 weeks then we’ve just got to find a way.\". AFL players have cut a deal with the AFL that will reduce their pay by 50% with that figure set to increase to 70% if the season is delayed beyond May 31st representing a dramatic decrease in player wages. Despite reports from the pub, Dangerfield did not comment on an alleged sighting of him at Dan Murphy's picking up a carton of hammer and tongs, leading to speculation that AFL players are running out of beer money. It is alleged that the dwindling beer money is the reason behind the players recent backflip on their stance on quarantine hubs."
