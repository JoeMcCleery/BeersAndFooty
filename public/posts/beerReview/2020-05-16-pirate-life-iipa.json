I marked the ball in the goal square, was set up to kick the winning goal at full time, but managed to kick it out on the full then yak on the goal umpire. Strong percentage beers will do that to ya, the can I had came in at whopping 500ml with 8.8% of the good stuff per volume. Not Bad, just keep it one ice till after the game."
