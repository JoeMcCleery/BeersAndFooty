After the first sip or two I could tell that this beer does have potential but it also kinda tastes like a mate put some toothpaste in ya beer as a prank. I'm not laughing. If Bodriggy Brewing took out the mint lollies they add during the brewing process then they could be on a winner. A nice refreshing Sour beer to cool off after those long sessions of king of the pack with the boiz."
