The proposed plan would see three quarantine hubs set up in Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia.  Each hub would see six teams based in that hub for 3 weeks. Channel 7 is proposing a reality television series where cameras film the players in a lock in local footy club situation where they are locked in the same room with 4000 cartons of vb, XXXX gold and Emu Export for a period of 21 days. The lockin will reportedly be located in large warehouses and last for 21 days and film the antics of the players on the fkn piss. Sources close to the AFL reveal that they are seriously consider the option as they are totally fucked and desperate."
